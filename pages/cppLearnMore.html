      <h3>Introduction :</h3>
      <p>
        C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.<br />

        C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br />

        C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.<br />

        The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.<br /><br />

      </p>
      <h3>Why use css ?</h3>
      <p>
        C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.<br />

        C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.<br />

        C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
        reused, lowering development costs.<br />

        C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.<br />

        C++ is fun and easy to learn!<br />

        As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.</p>
      <br /><br />
      <h3> C++ Get Started :</h3>
      To start using C++, you need two things:

      A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code<br />
      A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand<br />
      There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see
      below).<br /><br />
      <h3>C++ Install IDE</h3>
      An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.<br />

      Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both
      edit and debug C++ code.<br />

      Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.<br />

      We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.<br />

      You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file,
      which will install the text editor with a compiler.<br />

      <h3>C++ Quickstart :</h3>
      <p>Let's create our first C++ file.<br />

        Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.<br />

        Write the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File > Save File as):</p><br />
      <b>
        <hr>
        include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />
        using namespace std;<br />

        int main() {<br />
        cout
        << "Hello World!" ;<br />
        return 0;<br />
        }<br />
        <hr>
      </b><br />
      <h3>c++ syntax :</h3><br />
      Let's break up the following code to understand it better:<br />
      <hr>
      <b>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />
        using namespace std;<br />

        int main() {<br />
        cout
        << "Hello World!" ;<br />
        return 0;<br />
        }
      </b><br />
      <hr>
      <h4>Example explained</h4><br />
      Line 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout
        (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.<br />

        Line 2: using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard
        library.<br />
        Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.<br />

        Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main(). This is called a function. Any code
        inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.<br />

        Line 5: cout (pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (
        <<) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World" .<br />

        Note: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;<br />

        Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:<br />

        int main () { cout
        << "Hello World! " ; return 0; } Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the
          code more readable.<br />

        Line 6: return 0 ends the main function.<br />

        Line 7: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.<br /><br />
        <h3>c++ variables</h3>
        Variables are containers for storing data values.<br />

        In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:<br />

        <b>int</b>- stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123<br />
        <b>double</b> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99<br />
        <b>char</b> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes<br />
        <b>string</b> - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes<br />
        <b>bool</b>- stores values with two states: true or false<br /><br />
        <h4>Declaring (Creating) Variables</h4>
        <hr>
        <b>syntax<br />
          type variableName = value;<br />
        </b>
        <hr>
        Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or
        myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.<br />

        To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:<br />

        Example :
        Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:<br />
        <hr><b>
          int myNum = 15;<br />
          cout << myNum; <hr></b>
        You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:<br />
        <hr><b>
          int myNum;<br />
          myNum = 15;<br />
          cout << myNum; </b>
            Other Types<br />
            A demonstration of other data types:<br />

            Example<br />
            <hr>
            <b>
              int myNum = 5; // Integer (whole number without decimals)<br />
              double myFloatNum = 5.99; // Floating point number (with decimals)<br />
              char myLetter = 'D'; // Character<br />
              string myText = "Hello"; // String (text)<br />
              bool myBoolean = true; // Boolean (true or false)<br />
            </b>
            <h4>Display Variables :</h4><br />
            The cout object is used together with the
            << operator to display variables.<br />

            To combine both text and a variable, separate them with the
            << operator:<br />
            <b>
              <hr>
              Example<br />
              int myAge = 35;<br />
              cout
              << "I am " << myAge << " years old." ;<br />
            </b>
            <hr>
            <h4>Add Variables Together</h4><br />
            To add a variable to another variable, you can use the + operator:<br />
            <hr><b>
              Example
              int x = 5;
              int y = 6;
              int sum = x + y;
              cout << sum; </b>
                <hr>
