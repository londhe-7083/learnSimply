        <b>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.
          It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.</b><br />

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The term PHP is an acronym for PHP:<b> Hypertext Preprocessor. </b>PHP is a <br />
        server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.<br />
        It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very<br />
        simple to learn and use. The files have the extension <b>“.php”.</b> <br />
        Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participated in the later <br />
        versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. </p><br />

      <h3>PHP Full Form</h3>
      <p><b>PHP is the abbreviation of Hypertext Preprocessor and earlier it was abbreviated<br />
          as Personal Home Page.</b> It is a general-purpose programming language used to design<br />
        a website or web application. It is the server-side scripting language embedded with <br />
        HTML to develop <b>Static website, Dynamic website</b>, or <b>Web applications.</b> It was created by <br />
        <b> Rasmus Lerdorf </b>in <b>1994.</b> The syntax of PHP is similar to C, C++, and Java. It manages the<br />
        dynamic content, database, session, cookies, etc of a dynamic website.
      </p>


      <h3>Characteristics of PHP:</h3>
      <b> . Open Source: </b>It is an open-source programming language so it can download freely.<br />
      Simplicity: Since PHP does not include libraries like C/C++ so its structure is simple.<br />
      It contains lots of pre-defined functions to secure your data. Execution of PHP starts<br />
      from (
      <?php) and end with closing escape sequence (?>).<br />
      <b>. Efficiency: </b>PHP 4.0 uses resource allocation mechanisms and object-oriented programming, <br />
      in addition to session management features. It eliminates unnecessary memory allocation.<br />
      <b>. Security:</b> Many encryption functions are supported by PHP to secure the data.<br />
      <b>. Flexibility:</b> It is a very flexible language because it can be embedded with HTML, CSS,<br />
      JavaScript, XML, and many other languages. Also, the PHP code can be run on any device like Phone,<br />
      Tabs, Laptops etc.<br />
      <b>. Object-Oriented:</b> The object-oriented programming features are added in PHP 4.0.<br />

      <h3>Advantages of PHP: </h3>
      <p>
        <b>.</b>It is supported by all Operating Systems like Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.It is integrated <br />
        with other programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc) and databased.<br />
        <b>.</b>It is easy to connect with the database to store and retrieve data from the database. Multiple <br />
        databases can also be integrated with PHP.<br />
        <b>.</b>It is the fastest programming language compared to other programming languages.<br />
        <b>.</b> PHP frameworks and tools are used to protect web applications from outer attacks and security threats.
      </p>


      <h3>Disadvantages of PHP:</h3>
      <b>.</b>Since PHP is open-source so its code is visible to all programmers. If any bugs exist in the <br />
      source code then its weakness can be explored by other programmers.<br />
      <b>.</b>It is not suitable for large applications because its maintenance is difficult.<br />
      <b>.</b>he error handling of a PHP framework is not good.<br />

      <h3>Basic PHP Syntax</h3>
      A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.<br />
      A PHP script starts with <br />
      ?php and ends with ?>:<br />
      <b>
        ?php<br />
        <b>//</b> PHP code goes here<br />
        ?><br />
      </b>
